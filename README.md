## üß© Awesome features
1. This repository implement a business system, which consists of two parts: User related function and background management function
2. The business system depends on the api of the im system ([open-im-server repository](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server)) and implement various functions by calling the api of the im system
3. User related part includes some regular functions like user login, user register, user info update, etc.
4. Background management provides api for admin to manage the im system containing functions like user management, message mangement,group management,etc.

## üõ´ Quick start 

> **Note**: You can get started quickly with OpenIM Chat.

### üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/chat openim-chat && export openim-chat=$(pwd)/openim-chat && cd $openim-chat && make
```

### Developing chat

You can deploy OpenIM Chat in two ways, either from source (which requires openIM-server to be installed) or with [docker compose](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker)

**Here's how to deploy from source code:**

If you wish to deploy chat, then you should first install and deploy OpenIM, this [open-im-server repository](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server)

First, install openim-server in a new directory or location repository

```bash
git clone -b release-v3.4 https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server.git openim && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim
sudo docker compose up -d
```

**Setting configuration items:**

```bash
make init
```

> Then modify the configuration file `config/config.yaml` according to your needs
> Note: If you want to use the mysql database, you need to modify the mysql configuration item in the configuration file. If you want to use the mongo database, you need to modify the mongo configuration item in the configuration file


Then go back to the chat directory, Installing Chat

**Start Mysql:**

> The newer versions of OpenIM remove the Mysql component, which requires an additional Mysql installation if you want to deploy chat

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mysql4 \
  -p 13306:3306 \
  -p 3306:33060 \
  -v "$(pwd)/components/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql" \
  -v "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime" \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="openIM123" \
  --restart always \
  mysql:5.7
```

**Install Chat:**

```bash
$ make build
$ make start
$ make check
```

## üõ´ Quick start 

> **Note**: You can get started quickly with chat.

### üöÄ Run

> **Note**: 
> We need to run the backend server first

```bash
$ make build

# OR build Specifying binary
$ make build BINS=admin-api

# OR build multiarch
$ make build-multiarch
$ make build-multiarch BINS="admin-api"

# OR use scripts build source code
$ ./scripts/build_all.sh
```
